## Introduction

Welcome to the FLBRACE Project Repository! Here, we embark on a transformative journey aimed at enhancing the FLBRACE website to better serve the diverse needs of users navigating climate-related health issues in Florida. Our project revolves around understanding user requirements, improving usability, and creating an engaging platform that empowers individuals with knowledge and resources.

## Purpose:

The primary objective of this project is to revamp the FLBRACE website to provide an intuitive, informative, and accessible experience for various stakeholders, including health professionals, activists, government officials, and the general public. By delving into user needs and refining the website's design and content, we aspire to contribute to better public health outcomes by facilitating informed decision-making regarding climate change impacts in Florida.



## User Research Summary
The user research conducted for the FLBRACE website redesign project reveals critical insights aimed at improving usability, design, and content accessibility. Users, including environmental activists, public health professionals, and seniors, expressed challenges with navigation, outdated design, and complex content. They emphasized the need for intuitive navigation, simplified language, engaging visuals, and interactive features. Technical issues such as broken links and inadequate menu visibility further hindered user experience. By addressing these identified needs through a user-centric approach, including redesigning navigation, enhancing design aesthetics, simplifying content, and ensuring technical functionality, the FLBRACE website aims to become a more engaging, intuitive, and inclusive platform for all users concerned with climate change and health in Florida.

## Storyboard


#### 1. Simple Task: Header/Footer and BRACE Framework Subsection Design

A general user(common people) initially views a website on a large monitor with a horizontal
navigation bar. As the user switches to a mobile device, the navigation condenses into a Tree
icon. Tapping the icon reveals a vertical menu, but frustration arises when dropdown options are
too small. With resized dropdowns optimized for mobile, the user happily experiences smooth
navigation adaptation.

#### 2. Medium Task: 
A Florida resident, contemplating relocation, visits the FLBrace website to assess hazard impacts in different areas. They navigate to the About section and access the Florida Vulnerability Assessment. Upon selecting the full report option, they delve into studying hazard data, enabling them to make informed decisions regarding location selection

#### 3. Complex Task: 
A general user explores the FLBrace website's webinar series section and chooses a category of interest. Subsequently, they select a specific webinar based on brief descriptions, enabling them to engage in targeted viewing of desired content. This interactive experience facilitates enhanced accessibility and engagement with the webinar platform
